 You, a young outcast of the village have escaped your captors.
You were mutilated as a young child by polio and AIDS. You are 17.
You were a slave boy in the local castle and the master allowed you to read some of his books on philosophy. 
You have become an existential nihilist.
You really enjoy math but you dislike people as they remind you of your dead family which you watched being burned alive because they had the plague.
You still have a blanket which smells like your dear dead mother...and the black death.| 
You find a map in the dungeon while you are escaping, you feel determined to find what is at the X..|
