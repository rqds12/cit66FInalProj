You, young paladin begin in a dark cave, injured & find a map with your weapon|
You exit the cave and your map has a location scrawled on it in what apears to be orc blood. the prefered ink of your trade.|
You are a Paladin, a warrior of god, trained from birth to fight the resurgence of evil in this realm.|
You carry a sword passed on by your uncle, Mithradates, the last paladin to protect this county and the most famous in the dominion. |
He was gravely wounded in the battle of Ephesus, a witch rebelion. He now lies in what is soon to be his death bed at your home.|
You have been dispatched by St. Augustine himself, terminating your training early in the hope that you will embody the same fervor as your uncle.||
