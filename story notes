  paladin intro text----------------------------
begin in a dark cave, injured & find map with medicine and your weapon
You exit the cave and your map has a location scrawled on it in what apears to be orc blood. the prefered ink of your people.
You are a Paladin, a warrior of god, trained from birth to fight the resurgance of evil in this realm.
You carry a sword passed on by your uncle, Mithradates, the last paladin to protect this county and the most famous in the dominion. 
He was gravely wounded in the battle of Ephesus, a witch rebelion. He now lies in what is soon to be his death bed at your home.
You have been disbatched by St. Augustine himself, terminating your training early in the hope that you will embody the same fervor as your uncle.
